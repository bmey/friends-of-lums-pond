##### Each year, the Friends of Lums Pond State Park reflects on another year of successful endeavors.

Celebrate all the hard work, dedication and accomplishments that took place in 2023 and get a glimpse of what is to come in 2024. Hear from our program leaders and park partners about the state of FOLP in a presentation followed by light refreshments and beverages.

Please join us at the Nature Center for the 2024 Annual Meeting. It's a great opportunity to learn about FOLP and the park itself.
