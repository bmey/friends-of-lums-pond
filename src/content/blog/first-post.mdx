## Pond Edge Trash Clean Up
By Bryan Mey

We are thrilled to share the success of our recent clean-up event at Lums Pond! Spearheaded by director Chriss Funcheon, this gathering brought together our passionate community to restore the pond's natural beauty and preserve its serenity.

Equipped with paddles, life vests, and a shared purpose, our dedicated volunteers embarked on a mission to remove trash and fishing lines from the water. As they ventured onto the calm waters of the pond, they encountered not only the expected fishing lines but also a fascinating array of lost items, including approximately 15 hats!

Thanks to the unwavering efforts of our attendees, the pond's aesthetic appeal was restored, and its inhabitants were protected. By cutting down tangled fishing lines from trees and clearing away debris, we ensured a safer environment for the wildlife that calls the pond home.

Beyond the successful clean-up, the event fostered a sense of community and camaraderie among our participants. Newcomers and long-time supporters alike came together, forming lasting connections and potentially finding new paddle buddies. We are proud to see our Friends of Lums Pond community grow stronger through these shared experiences.

This accomplishment serves as a reminder of the power of collective action and our organization's commitment to responsible stewardship. By actively engaging in conservation efforts, we set an inspiring example for others to follow. Together, we can protect and preserve the natural wonders that surround us.

We look forward to future events and the opportunity to continue working together in preserving the beauty of our beloved Lums Pond.
