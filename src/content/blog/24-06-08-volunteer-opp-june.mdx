Help the park cut back vegetation on a high-priority trail or trail section and improve accessibility for hikers, runners, and bike riders.
This is a free event. Experience, tools (loppers and pruning saws), and gloves are welcome, but they’re not required. If you’re interested, we’d love to see you there!
