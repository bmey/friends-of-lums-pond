Either way, it's all bubbling with positivity and progress so grab a seat--maybe your favorite trail snack--and dive into these updates with us. I'm so glad you are here for it because this is just the beginning of something big.

Part of our mission and vision of the friends group involves increasing our
contributions and aspirations for Lums Pond. We plan on spearheading multiple
projects and campaigns to achieve these goals. The board has put together a
roadmap of our goals for the next few years. We encourage you to check it out,
get excited about the things in store for the friends group, and welcome you to
participate in reaching these goals!

## Announcement 2: Added Membership Benefits and Dues

<Image class="full" src="24-09-12_hands.png"></Image>

As we mentioned in Announcement 1, we have great aspirations for the group. Greater aspirations requires an investment in how we organize ourselves, use tools to meet our needs, and show gratitude for our gracious volunteers that make our dreams become a reality. In order to achieve these things, we need a predictable income stream and a deeper level of engagement with our members. Our board has decided to introduce annual membership dues of $10 per year. Dues will be tax-deductible donations and directly fund our operations, goals, and therefore Lums Pond! We appreciate your understanding and if you have any questions or concerns, please let us know at <a href="mailto:membership@friendsoflumspond.org">membership@friendsoflumspond.org</a>.

The new member benefits are as follows:

- Receive one rotating member-exclusive sticker each year. Check out the one for 2024 here! You can receive yours in-person at any of our volunteer events. Please contact the volunteer coordinator when you arrive.
- Access to our organization's IT software.
- A personalized @friendsoflumspond.org email address and inbox.
- Ability to purchase member-exclusive merch such as volunteer shirts and stickers.
- Receive member-only communications such as voting, event planning, and organization changes.
- Be a part of a community that invests in nature and shares your love of the park.

## Announcement 3: New Organization Software

We have decided to adopt several software tools to help facilitate and organize our operations, improve communication and make role changes easier. Some examples of our software needs:

- Business collaboration
- Password management
- Marketing content design
- Donations
- Product & event ticket purchases
- Information gathering forms
- Volunteer onboarding
- and more

Find out more about our software tools in our onboarding documentation you receive during your application process. Only members who have paid their annual dues will be granted access to our software tools. If you are already a paying member, please reach out to <a href="mailto:membership@friendsoflumspond.org">membership@friendsoflumspond.org</a> for assistance.

This announcement is way overdue, but that is not a reflection on the value and importance of it. We are please to announce that Patty Jacob stepped up and accepted the role of secretary for 2024. She jumped right into the frying pan and has been working with our executive committee since late April. Congratulations, Patty, and thank you for your efforts with Lums Pond!

## Announcement 5: Pond Fest - Concert for a Cause

<Image class="full" src="24-09-12_guitar.jpg"></Image>

We already mentioned this in a previous announcement, but it's worth re-emphasizing this event. This fundraiser not only has legs--it is already sprinting. The amount of interest and feedback from the local community has been almost overwhelming as if we are all craving something positive and pure to pour our hearts into. It is going to be a hit! We're planning so many fun things - beer and seltzer from local breweries, hot food truck, vendors, crafters, moon bounce, live music, and so much more. We already have almost TWENTY different groups interested in participating. We've got non-profits, hobbyists, and sponsors! It's hard to explain how exciting this will be and we're only just getting started. Come join us on 11/10 in Area 1! Volunteering is also highly encouraged and welcomed. You can find out more using the link below.
