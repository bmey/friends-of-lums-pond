We are pleased to announce an annual sticker program, exclusive to members of
the Friends of Lums Pond State Park. The one exclusive to 2024 can be seen
above! The iconic Lums Pond blue heron sporting a pair of sunglasses. Each year,
we will announce a new sticker design for that year that members will receive
and can iron on to their volunteer shirt (if they desire). An example of how it
might look to iron on these annual stickers is shown below.
