Join Delaware State Parks on Monday, January 1, 2024, and start the New Year outdoors!
Celebrate the New Year with us out in the park! We are meeting at the campground on the first day of the year for a guided hike in the forests and along the pond! Whether you are hiking with a group or on your own, make sure you check in (self-guided hikes will have a Welcome Station) to be counted for this event. Last year there were over 50,000 people in attendance across the nation! First Day Hike stickers and magnets will be available for hikers (while supplies last). Be sure to dress for the weather. Water bottle, appropriate walking shoes, and sun protection recommended. All hikes are free!
