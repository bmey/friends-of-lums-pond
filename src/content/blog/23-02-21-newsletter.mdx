## History Of Lums Pond

By Taylor Reynolds

First conceptualized as a Delaware State Park in 1963, Lums Pond is the largest freshwater pond in the state. Formed from the St. Georges Creek, the pond was created when the C&D Canal was built. Today, the park offers over seventeen miles of trails, Go Ape Treetop Course, a boathouse with watercraft to rent, a Dog Training Area, and more!
