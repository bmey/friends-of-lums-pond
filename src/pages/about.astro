      <h3>Park History</h3>
      <p>
        Lums Pond is a Delaware treasure, boasting the distinction of being the
        state's largest freshwater pond, covering 200 acres of the original 1790
        tract that now constitutes Lums Pond State Park. The park's rich history
        dates back to 1963 when it first became a state park. However, its
        origins trace to the early 1800s when the damming of St. Georges Creek
        and the construction of the C&D Canal created the iconic pond. Before
        this transformation, the creek flowed through a hardwood forest, serving
        as a hunting ground for Native American communities. The pond's waters
        powered the canal locks and a nearby mill.
