        <h2>What is Pond Fest?</h2>
        <h3>Friends of Lums Pond</h3>
        <p>
          Friends of Lums Pond, Inc. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
          preserving and enhancing Lums Pond State Park through volunteer
          efforts, fundraising, education, and advocacy. Operating independently
          since 2002, we work under a Friends agreement with Delaware State
          Parks, following their standards for volunteer organizations.

          Come talk to us at the information tables! You could even become a
          member!

        <h3>Pond Fest</h3>
        <p>
          Pond Fest is a concert for a cause hosted by the Friends of Lums Pond
          State Park. Our specific goals for this event are to fund youth
          scholarships as much as possible in 2025 and install the first bike
          repair station in the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group has reached out to our local community including small
          businesses, non-profits, crafters, volunteers, and clubs. The response
          has been incredibly rewarding and positive!
        </p>
        <p>
          The target goal is to raise $4,000. Please help us achieve our goal to
          give back to the park and community!
        </p>

        <p>
          We also have event-exclusive T-shirts for sale at the information
          tables!

        <h2>What are we fundraising for?</h2>

        <h3>Youth Scholarships</h3>
        <p>
          Scholarship funds increase access for Title 1 schools (schools with
          40% or more low-income families) to the outdoors through environmental
          education field trips by reducing the cost barrier to local schools.
          In the spring of 2024, Lums Pond had 524 students attend these field
          trips. Our ultimate goal is to subsidize as much of that as possible
          and enable more students to participate. To find out more or
          contribute, please visit our scholarship fundraising campaign using
          the QR below.

        <h3>Bike Repair Station</h3>
        <p>
          We want to improve the experience for bike riders in the park. We are
          targeting a double-sided Dero Fixit Plus bike repair station with Air
          Kit Prime attachment estimated at $2,149. It includes all the tools
          necessary to perform basic bike repairs like changing a flat or
          adjusting brakes. It is a well-known brand trusted and installed in
          several other DE state parks. We also need to raise funds for
          installing a concrete pad for the station. To find out more or
          contribute, please visit our bike station fundraising campaign using
          the QR below.

        <b>Bryan</b>
        <p>
          Bryan is the president of FOLP and one of the initiators of this
          event! What was once an idea has now become a reality, and the friends
          group could not be happier! An event like this requires lots of
          research, technological skills and leadership to get it off the
          ground. He is also performing in the live band - Lucky Stone.

          the gift of gab and connections, and loves to bring people together
          for a cause. She is also performing in the live music band - Lucky
          Stone.
          <br />
           Thank you, Jessie!

        <b>Jenny</b>
        <p>
          Jenny is a member of the FOLP and is the overseer of vendor land! She
          can problem-solve, assemble groups, and push an event to new heights -
          all with a baby strapped to her back. Her knowledge and experience are
          very much appreciated.
          <br />Thank you, Jenny!
        </p>

        <b>Patty</b>
        <p>
