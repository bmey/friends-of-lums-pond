      <h2>What is Pond Fest?</h2>
      <h3>Friends of Lums Pond</h3>
      <p>
        Friends of Lums Pond, Inc. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
        preserving and enhancing Lums Pond State Park through volunteer efforts,
        fundraising, education, and advocacy. Operating independently since
        2002, we work under a Friends agreement with Delaware State Parks,
        following their standards for volunteer organizations.

      <h3>Pond Fest</h3>
      <p>
        Pond Fest is a concert for a cause hosted by the Friends of Lums Pond
        State Park. Our specific goals for this event are to fund youth
        scholarships as much as possible in 2025 and install an accessible kayak 
        launch ramp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our group has reached out to our local community including small
        businesses, non-profits, crafters, volunteers, and clubs. The response
        has been incredibly rewarding and positive!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal this year is to raise $10,000. Please help us achieve our goal to
        give back to the park and community!
      </p>

      <p>
        We also have event-exclusive T-shirts for sale at the information
        tables!

      <h2>What are we fundraising for?</h2>

      <h3>Youth Scholarships</h3>
      <p>
        Scholarship funds increase access for Title 1 schools (schools with 40%
        or more low-income families) to the outdoors through environmental
        education field trips by reducing the cost barrier to local schools. In
        the spring of 2024, Lums Pond had 524 students attend these field trips.
        Our ultimate goal is to subsidize as much of that as possible and enable
        more students to participate. To find out more or contribute, please
        visit our
        <a href="https://donorbox.org/2025-youth-scholarships">

        </a>.

      <h3>Accessible Kayak Launch</h3>
      <p>
        We want to make Lums Pond more accessible so that everyone has the chance to enjoy being on the water. This year we are targeting a BoardSafe Accessible Kayak Launch, a nationally recognized system designed with adaptive features that make it safer and easier for people of all abilities to launch and land their kayaks. The launch includes transfer platforms, handrails, and stability features that allow users greater independence. By funding this project, we will open Lums Pond’s waters to more visitors than ever before.

        What was once an idea has now become a reality, and the friends group

        gift of gab and connections, and loves to bring people together for a
