      <h3>Friends of Lums Pond</h3>
      <p>
        Friends of Lums Pond, Inc. is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
        preserving and enhancing Lums Pond State Park through volunteer efforts,
        fundraising, education, and advocacy. Operating independently since
        2002, we work under a Friends agreement with Delaware State Parks,
        following their standards for volunteer organizations.

      <h3>Pond Fest</h3>
      <p>
        Pond Fest is a concert for a cause hosted by the Friends of Lums Pond
        State Park. Our specific goals for this event are to fund youth
        scholarships as much as possible in 2025 and install the first bike
        repair station in the park.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our group has reached out to our local community including small
        businesses, non-profits, crafters, volunteers, and clubs. The response
        has been incredibly rewarding and positive!
      </p>
      <p>
        The target goal is to raise $4,000. Please help us achieve our goal to
        give back to the park and community!
      </p>

      <p>
        We also have event-exclusive T-shirts for sale at the information
        tables!

      <h2>What are we fundraising for?</h2>

      <h3>Youth Scholarships</h3>
      <p>
        Scholarship funds increase access for Title 1 schools (schools with 40%
        or more low-income families) to the outdoors through environmental
        education field trips by reducing the cost barrier to local schools. In
        the spring of 2024, Lums Pond had 524 students attend these field trips.
        Our ultimate goal is to subsidize as much of that as possible and enable
        more students to participate. To find out more or contribute, please

        What was once an idea has now become a reality, and the friends group

         Thank you, Bryan!

        Jessie is a member of the FOLP and is experience-focused - for both
        attendees and volunteers - and values community outreach. Jessie has the
        gift of gab and connections, and loves to bring people together for a
        cause. She is also performing in the live music band - Lucky Stone.

      <p>
        Jenny is a member of the FOLP and is the overseer of vendor land! She
        can problem-solve, assemble groups, and push an event to new heights -

        very much appreciated.
        <br />Thank you, Jenny!
      </p>

      <b>Patty</b>
      <p>
        Patty is the secretary of FOLP and queen of beverages and crafts. Patty
        has recruited some of our favorite breweries to the event, and is one of
        the live music acts - PJ’s Pub Tour! Her dedication to the event has
